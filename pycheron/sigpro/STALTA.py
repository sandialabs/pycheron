    The STALTA method applies one of several STA/LTA "first break picking" algorithms to obspy trace data in

    :param increment: the increment to use when sliding the averaging windows to the next location. Note for
                      higher resolution channels, picking an increment of 2/sampling rate can greatly speed up
                      processing times and still generate reasonable results.

    By default, this method uses the ``"classic_LR"`` algorithm which calculates the average power in the trace data
    over a short window (STA) and a long window (LTA). With this algorithm, windows are "left/right aligned" meaning
    that the point for which STA/LTA is calculated is at the lefttmost edge of the STA window and the rightmost edge
    of the LTA window. The resulting STA/LTA ratio thus has the same number of points as the original data. This is a
    standard method of "first break picking" and can be used to identify the onset of a seismic event. [#]_ [#]_ [#]_

    **Methodology**

    1. ``algorithm = "classic_RR"``. This is the original STA/LTA algorithm with "right alignment" [#]_

    .. math::

        STA(x_{i}) = (1/ns)\sum_{j = i-ns}^{i} x_{i}^{2}

        LTA(x_{i}) = (1/nl)\sum_{j = i-nl}^{i} x_{i}^{2}

        r_{i} = STA_{i}/LTA_{i}

    .. code-block:: console

       [---------- LTA ---------*]
                       [-- STA -*]

    2. ``algorithm = "classic_LR"`` (default). This algorithm has the index at the left edge of the STA window and the
       right edge of the LTA window. [#]_

    .. math::

        STA(x_{i}) = (1/ns)\sum_{j = i+ns}^{i} x_{i}^{2}

        LTA(x_{i}) = (1/nl)\sum_{j = i-nl}^{i} x_{i}^{2}

        r_{i} = STA_{i}/LTA_{i}

    .. code-block:: console

       [---------- LTA --------*]
                              [*- STA --]

    3. ``algorithm = "EarleAndShearer_envelope"`` [#]_

    .. math::

       STA(x_{i}) = (1/ns)\sum_{j=i}^{i+ns} mod(H(x))_{i}

       LTA(x_{i}) = (1/nl)\sum_{j=i-nl}^{i} mod(H(x))_{i}

       r_{i} = STA_{i}/LTA_{i}

    where: *H(x)* is the hilbert transform of the data and *mod(H(x))* is the 'envelope' of the seismic signal

    .. code-block:: console

       [---------- LTA ---------*]
                               [*- STA --]

    .. note:: Because the Hilbert transform involves performing an FFT of the data it can take significantly longer than
              the "classic" algorithms for longer seismic signals (>500,000 pts)}

    **Example**

    .. code-block:: python

        from obspy.clients.fdsn import Client
        from obspy import UTCDateTime
        from pycheron.sigpro.STALTA import STALTA

        #Instantiate client object
        client = Client("IRIS")

        #Grab data from 2010-02-27 to 2010-02-28
        t = UTCDateTime("2010-02-27T00:00:00.000")
        st = client.get_waveforms("IU","ANMO","00","BHZ",t,t+1440*60)
        tr = st[0]
        picker = STALTA(tr,3,30)

    **Plotting**

    .. code-block:: python

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # Plot the trace and overlay the picker (on separate axes for easier viewing)
        fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()
        # Uses output from above example
        ln1 = ax1.plot(tr,color='blue', label = 'raw data')
        ax1.set_xlabel('Number of points')
        ax1.set_ylabel('Amplitude', color ='blue')

        # Create picker axis and plot
        ax2=ax1.twinx()
        # Uses output from above example
        ln2 = ax2.plot(picker, color = 'red', label = 'picker')
        ax2.set_ylabel('Amplitude', color = 'red')

        # Create combined legend
        lns = ln1+ln2
        labs = [l.get_label() for l in lns]
        ax1.legend(lns,labs)
