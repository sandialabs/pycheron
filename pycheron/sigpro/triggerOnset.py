def triggerOnset(x, picker, threshold=None, index=False):
    """

    Uses vector returned by STALTA "first break picking" method and a user selected threshold to determine the arrival
    time of a seismic event.

    :param x:  obspy trace object
    :type x: obspy.core.trace.Trace
    :param picker: Results from applying the STALTA method to this trace
    :type picker: numpy.array
    :param threshold: Optional numeric value of the threshold at which triggering should occur.
                      Note the appropriate value for the threshold will depend upon the exact STA/LTA algorithm used
                      and the noise level in the signal.
    :type threshold: float
    :param index: Optional boolean to return the index (rather than the time) of event onset.
    :type index: bool

    :return: Returns a single value identifying the onset of the seismic event or None if nothing is detected. The
             returned value will be a time by default, or a numeric index if index = True.
    :rtype: float or None

    Method simply identifies the point at which the picker first rises above the threshold, e.g., only returns the first
    time point or None at which STALTA is above threshold. It does not implement the full functionality found in obspy
    method of the same name as is not currently needed at this point, but maybe a TODO later:
    (http://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.signal.trigger.triggerOnset.html)

    When no threshold is supplied, an appropriate value is calculated from the picker with:

    ``threshold = scipy.stats.mstats.quantile(picker, 0.999)``

    **Example**

    .. code-block:: python

        from obspy.clients.fdsn import Client
        from obspy import UTCDateTime
        from pycheron.sigpro.STALTA import STALTA
        from pycheron.sigpro.triggerOnset import triggerOnset

        # Instantiate client object
        client = Client("IRIS")

        # Grab data from 2010-02-27 06:00:00 to 2010-02-27 09:00:00
        t = UTCDateTime("2010-02-27T06:00:00.000")
        st = client.get_waveforms("IU","ANMO","00","BHZ",t,t+180*60)
        tr = st[0]
        picker = STALTA(tr,3,30)

    **Plotting**

    .. code-block:: python

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # Using results from above example
        plt.plot(tr)
        plt.axvline(x=to,color = 'red')

    .. image:: _static/triggerOnset.png

    """

    # Figure out if missing values for threshold and index and set appropriately
    if threshold is None:
        threshold = mquantiles(picker[~np.isnan(picker)], 0.99999)

    if index is None:
        index = False

    # Find first index above the threshold provided. In case only one, grab only the first index
    eventIndex = int(np.argwhere(picker[~np.isnan(picker)] > threshold)[0])

    # Add indices that are nans into the calculation as otherwise will be too early. Had to ignore them in above
    # calculation as otherwise would just give nan value
    np_end = int(np.argwhere(~np.isnan(picker))[0])
    eventIndex += np_end

    # Return just the index if desired
    if index is True:
        return eventIndex

    # Otherwise calculate the time at which that index occurs and return it
    if not eventIndex:
        eventTime = None
    else:
        eventTime = x.stats.starttime + eventIndex / x.stats.sampling_rate
    return eventTime
