"""
When the pick algorithm is used the key for the snr metric is lowercase, snr,
however when the other two algorithms are used the key is uppercase, SNR.
This might cause some issues if the result is passed into other functions

Condition where if (tr.stats.endtime - tr.stats.starttime) < 60:
                    snr = 'Not calculated because data does not fill the window'
However, the algorithm does not exit and continues to evaluate snrMetric. 
Is this behavior what is wanted, or should it exit?
