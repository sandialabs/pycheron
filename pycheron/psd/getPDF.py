def getPDF(noise, lo=-200, hi=-49, binSize=1):
    """
    This functions takes a noise matrix and computes a probability density function (PDF) as defined by McNamara and
    Boaz [#]_.

    The McNamara and Boaz paper describes creating histograms of the discretized power levels at each frequency bin
    associated with a set of PSDs. THe value in each cell of the PDF matrix is the fraction of the corrected PSDs that
    have a power level at that frequency bin.

    .. note::
        To return a PDF matrix that matches those in the McNamara paper, use the default settings.

    :param noise: Noise matrix returned from getNoise function
    :type noise: numpy.ndarray
    :param lo: Lowest frequency bin (power level in dB) for the PDF y-axis
    :type lo: int
    :param hi: Highest frequency bin (power level in dB) for the PDF y-axis. ( **Note:** Python does not include the
     last integer, so if the highest freq you want is -50, you must input -49)
    :type hi: int
    :param binSize: Size in dB of each bin.
    :type binSize: int

    :return: Array of probability density values; rows=dB level, columns=frequencies, e.g.,
                        row1 corresponds to lowest frequency bin (e.g., if using default values -200, next row would be
                        -199, etc.)
