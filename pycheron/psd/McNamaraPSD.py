    **Methodology**

    The PSD algorithm is designed to be used on one to three hour segments of seismic data and will return output
    containing the (potentially binned) spectrum for that segment. The McNamara algorithm is similar to MATLAB's
    pwelch [#]_ function and has the following steps:

    1. Calculate the average spectrum

       a. Truncate incoming segment of trace data to the nearest power of 2 samples.

       b. Divide each truncated segment into 13 chunks with 75% overlap
          First chunk begins at 0/16 and ends at 4/16. The 13'th chunk begins at 12/16 and ends at 16/16.
          The chunks overlap in the following manner

          .. code-block:: console

                1---5---9---3---
                 2---6---0---
                  3---7---1---
                   4---8---2---

       c. Demean, detrend, and taper the chunk

       d. Calculate the one-sided spectrum for the chunk

       e. Average all 13 spectra to get an averaged spectrum

    2. Create smoothed version of spectrum with binning

       When ``binned = True`` , McNamara style binning is turned on and a smoothed spectrum is returned that contains
       many fewer points than the full spectrum. When these arguments are not specified, binning is automatically turned
       off and the full spectrum is returned.

       Frequencies for binning are generated at 1/8 octave intervals aligned to alignFreq. The power (dB) associated
       with each frequency bin is calculated by averaging over the entire octave centered at that frequency.

       **Note:** The spectra returned by ``McNamaraPSD()`` have not had instrument correction applied.

    3. Convert binned spectra to decibels

    **Example**

    .. code-block:: python

        #import function
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from pycheron.psd.McNamaraPSD import McNamaraPSD

        #test data
        data = 'test/test_data/7a_cabn_bhe.884965.tar.mseed'

        #reading in stream
        st = obspy.read(data)

        #getting trace
        tr = st[0]

        #defining parameters
        loFreq =.005 #Default
        hiFreq =10 #Default
        alignFreq = .1 #Defualt
        binned = True #Defualt

        psd = McNamaraPSD(tr, loFreq=.005, hiFreq=10, alignFreq=.1, binned=True)

        #Flags to obtain this data are (note these are uncorrected!!!!):
        #   psd[0] = frequency
        #   psd[1] = psd
        #   psd[2] = snclq
        #   psd[3] = Starttime of data segment
        #   psd[4] = Starttime of data segment

        # Output not shown for brevity
        print 'Frequency:', psd[0] #Frequency
        print 'PSD:', psd[1] #PSDs
        print 'SNCLQ:', psd[2] #SNCLQ
